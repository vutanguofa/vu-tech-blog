# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge: vu-tech-blog

## Description

This repo includes a blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The idea behind this app is to allow "techies" to post details about issues they've come across and allow solutions, similarly to stackoverflow. Developers are able to create their own unique username and password to enter the site to post, view, and comment on their own or other developers' posts.
